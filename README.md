# Readspss [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JanMarvin/readspss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JanMarvin/readspss) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/JanMarvin/readspss?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JanMarvin/readspss)

R package using Rcpp to parse an SPSS file into a data.frame(). Currently 
`read.sav` and `read.por` are the main functions and feature of this package.
Writing of SPSS files is provided by `write.por` and `write.sav`. Writing is
limited to uncompressed por and sav files and to compressed sav file.

It works. Testing is welcome though the package is still at an early stage. Its
read function is extensively tested on approximately 600+ sav-files and ~100
por-files. The code is maturing and is frequently tested. The read functions
imports everything into a data frame. Including long strings and labels. Various
features such as importing of value label or missings are tested and are working
as intended.

The package features reading of

* sav files,
* zsav files,
* encrypted sav files and
* por files

and (experimental) writing support of (un)compressed

* sav files and
* zsav files and
* por files.

Because of the R code wrapped Rcpp functions the package is pretty fast. The 
R code for factor conversion slows things down a bit, changing the encoding a
bit more.

In comparison to `haven` and `foreign` this package preforms pretty well. It
reads more files than each of its predecessors, some are only readable using
`readspss`and covers a few more cases of missing values.

Focus was not so much on winning every benchmark, but reading all features of
an SPSS file and to be as exactly as possible. So some benchmarks are
won and others are lost. It is entirely up to the task. Besides the data
itself `readspss` ships additional information provided by the SPSS files like
the data label, documentation, date and timestamp.

Reading of sav and por files is considered feature complete.

Writing of (un)compressed sav and por files is implemented and considered 
working. Unsupported features are reading and writing of dates and writing of
long strings.

## Installation

With `drat`:
```R
drat::addRepo("JanMarvin")
install.packages("readspss")
```

With `devtools`:
```R
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/JanMarvin/readspss.git")
```

## Usage

```R
fls <- system.file("extdata", "electric.sav", package="readspss")
flp <- system.file("extdata", "electric.por", package="readspss")

df_s <- read.sav(fls)
df_p <- read.por(flp)

all.equal(df_s, df_p, check.attributes = FALSE)
```
